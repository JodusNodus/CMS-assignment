## Deployment
I work on MacOS so it might be different on windows. 

### Wordpress
Made for Wordpress 5.
The `cms1` folder contains the `wordpress-duplicate-archive.zip` and `installer.php` required to restore my version using the Duplicator plugin.
SQL Dump and files needed for a manual migration are also available.

Check [Duplicator documentation](https://snapcreek.com/duplicator/docs/quick-start/) for instructions.

### Drupal
Made for Drupal 8. The `cms2` folder contains a backup made by the [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) plugin to make restoring easy.
SQL Dump and files needed for a manual migration are also available.

### Online deployment
For online deployment on pantheon: [guide](https://pantheon.io/docs/migrate-manual/).
